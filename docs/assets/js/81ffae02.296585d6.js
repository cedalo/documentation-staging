For instance, a message that arrives at a Mosquitto broker can be relayed to one or multiple topics within the Google Pub/Sub service. Similarly, a Mosquitto broker can fetch messages from one or more Google Pub/Sub topics and distribute them to one or several MQTT topics.

Currently, the integrated client supports only basic authentication (username, password). Topic mappings are used to specify which MQTT topic payloads should be inserted into which collection. Each insert can contain the fields payload, jsonPayload, topic, qos, clientid, hostname, retain, timestamp of the received MQTT message. By default, all these fields are included in the database insert command. If needed, Schema mappings_ are used to filter or rename these fields. The queueSize can be configured per MongoDB client, to specify a limit of not-yet-processed MQTT messages, before the plugin starts to drop them.
