For instance, a message that arrives at a Mosquitto broker can be relayed to one or multiple topics within the Google Pub/Sub service.

Each insert can contain the fields payload, jsonPayload, topic, qos, clientid, hostname, retain, timestamp of the received MQTT message. By default, all these fields are included in the database insert command. If needed, Schema mappings_ are used to filter or rename these fields. The queueSize can be configured per MongoDB client, to specify a limit of not-yet-processed MQTT messages, before the plugin starts to drop them.

We also now introduce the kubernetes support for Mosquitto. Kubernetes simplifies Mosquitto broker deployment by providing automated scaling, and easy updates. Our main objective is to offer Kubernetes support for Mosquitto to add support for manual scaling, automated scaling, easier deployment and orchestration of Mosquitto resources and of course reaching a wider audience by giving access to various tech stacks. Its container orchestration streamlines management and ensures high availability, making it ideal for IoT and real-time messaging applications. Kubernetes abstracts infrastructure complexities, allowing you to focus on building robust MQTT services efficiently."},"deployment/on-premises/installation/kubernetes/multi-node-single-host":{"id":"deployment/on-premises/installation/kubernetes/multi-node-single-host","title":"HA-Single-host","description":"To set up a multi-node Mosquitto broker and Management Center on a single host using Helm charts, you\'ll first need a Kubernetes environment.
