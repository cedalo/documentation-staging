Database
---------

Downloading a Database saves the current version of your Streamsheets installation. All Stream Machines, Streams, users, user roles, policies and labels are being saved in one big :term:`JSON` file.
This file can be restored in any Streamsheet installation at anytime.
Restart the complete Streamsheets Application after restoring the database from a backup file to finish the restore process.
