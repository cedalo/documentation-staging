Users
````````
This section contains tools to organize user-related aspects, such as user and their rights within Streamsheets. 
A user can either have viewing or administrative rights. An administrator has full power over all Streams and Apps, while the viewer is restricted to visual access. In the premium version it is possible to assign user to different workspaces with different roles.

.. |star| image:: /images/star.svg


Workspaces help to visually divide one Streamsheets installation in multiple instances. Every Workspace oversees their own Dashboard with Apps and Streams. This offers the opportunity to divide projects over different Workspaces and easily adjust user access to certain Workspaces. Workspaces are a premium feature and not part of the open source version. |star|


.. _Database:

Database
```````````````

Downloading a Database saves the current version of your Streamsheets installation. All Apps, Streams, Workspaces & Users are being saved in one big :term:`JSON` file.
This file can be restored in any Streamsheet installation at anytime.
Restart the complete Streamsheets Application after restoring the database from a backup file to finish the restore process.
